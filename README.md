__Course description:__

Drones are becoming a very useful tool in newsrooms to report on stories large and small. They're becoming a common element in video production environments, agriculture, construction, law enforcement and search and rescue, among others. But if you want to fly a drone for your job, you've got to get an FAA license first. While it isn't hard, it does require work on your part. It takes knowing the materials, which aren't the most straightforward you'll find. It helps to have a guide. That's what this class is all about.

__Course goals:__

Prepare students for the Part 107 test by covering the following topics:

* Part 107
* Airspace
* Weather
* Airport Operations
* Decision Making
* Ethics, privacy, operations
