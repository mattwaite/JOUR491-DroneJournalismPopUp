__Course description:__

Drones are becoming a very useful tool in newsrooms to report on stories large and small. They're becoming a common element in video production environments, agriculture, construction, law enforcement and search and rescue, among others. But if you want to fly a drone for your job, you've got to get an FAA license first. While it isn't hard, it does require work on your part. It takes knowing the materials, which aren't the most straightforward you'll find. It helps to have a guide. That's what this class is all about.

__Course goals:__

Prepare students for the Part 107 test by covering the following topics:

* Part 107
* Airspace
* Weather
* Airport Operations
* Decision Making
* Ethics, privacy, operations  

__Required texts:__

All materials will be provided.

* The Pilot Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge
* Part 107
* Various parts of the Federal Aviation Regulations

__Other requirements:__

* A laptop or device to take Canvas quizzes
* Your attention and attendance
* A sense of humor

__Grading:__

The course is pass/no pass. The FAA's threshold for pass is 70 percent. We'll use the same. The vast majority of the pass or no pass decision is in attendance. We have limited time. This class will be done in a day and a half. Miss any part of it and you won't pass. Attendance will be taken after every block.

Assignment|Weight
----------|------
Quizzes|35%
Attendance|65%

__Policies__

Here's the short version.

You cheat, you fail, no exceptions.

If I’m doing something that’s keeping you from learning, tell me. Tell the Dean. Tell someone, because that’s not cool. I won’t tolerate it from myself and you shouldn’t either.

Now the longer versions.

__ACEJMC Competencies__

After this class, you should be able to:

* Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information;
* Demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity;
* Apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work.

__Academic integrity:__

Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student's own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors. Academic dishonesty includes:

* Handing in another's work or part of another's work as your own.
* Turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.
* Turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes,
* Using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another's answers for a quiz or an examination.

Anything and everything you include in your work that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions.

Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.

__Students with disabilities__

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.

__Diversity__

The College of Journalism and Mass Communications values diversity, in the broadest sense of the word – gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, income, religion, education, geographic, physical and mental ability or disability, sexual orientation. We recognize that understanding and incorporating diversity in the curriculum enables us to prepare our students for careers as professional communicators in a global society. As communicators, we understand that journalism, advertising and other forms of strategic communication must reflect society in order to be effective and reliable. We fail as journalists if we are not accurate in our written, spoken and visual reports; including diverse voices and perspectives improves our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create advertising that reflects a diverse society and, thus, appeals to broader audiences.
